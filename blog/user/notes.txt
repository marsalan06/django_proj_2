we created a new app for the front end of the user authentication part, python mange.py startapp user
in views.py we create views of login and register , we render the concerned html files through it, htmls 
are registered in the urls.py file. In the urls.py we will use the path method to link the views with the 
urls, 
To store the htmls we will create the templates folder in the user and place the html files in it,but 
all html require a common html layout, thus we will create a new folder in the templates containing 
a new layout.html to avoid confusion with the posts's layout.html

for the front end we'll use the django's own admin panel front end, copy it in the layout.html, and copy
the body in login and register.html, we'll register the app in the settings.py, user.apps.UserConfig is
placed in the installed apps list, this allows the app.py file to have the user app to be registered by
itself, 
In the urls.py of blog add the user with path('user/',include('user.urls)), 

Using django's own forms to create user of the admin panel, that are in the admin panel,
1) login and register htmls were created using htmk code, but now we'll use the model forms that are
present in the django adminstration panel, this is differnt than the posts's model.form that we added in
models.py of the posts app, 
2) from login and register html files remove the code before the button, 
3) in views.py we'll import django.contrib.auth.forms with UserCreationForm and AuthenticationForm 
    UserCreationForm is for creating the user and AuthenticationForm is for login, 
4) in the login function we create a AuthenticationForm object and use it as a form key value pair
5) same goes for the UserCreationForm in the register function
6) placing it in the login and register.html files as a {{form.username}},{{from.password1.lable_tag}}
    under the form tag {% csrf_token %}
7) we style it by the css style tag in the layout.html file using .register .form-row #id_password1
8) same goes for the login.html file, 

Performing validation form
1) to stop empty form submition in the form of login and register under each <div class="form-row">
    we add an if case jinja code,
    {%if form.password1.errors%}
        {{form.password1.errors}} 
      {%endif%},
    this code verifys and validates data entered in multiple scenarios,
    jinja code doesnt show up in htmls
2) we create a if case in the register functon in views.py, if request.method=="POST": and in it 
    we place the form.is_valid() check
3) if we want a msg to be displayed in accordance to the form used we can use the settings.py's
    installed_app of 'django.contrib.messasges',  and the middleware of MessageMiddleware
4) in views.py of user we can import these messasges from django.contrib.messasges
    and redirect to the login page

5) in the login.html page we place the messasges check before the login form
